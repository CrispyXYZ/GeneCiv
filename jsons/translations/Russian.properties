Sediment samples from below the deep seafloor of the Mediterranean Sea, which include evaporite minerals, soils, and fossil plants, show that the precursor of the Strait of Gibraltar closed about 5.96 million years ago, sealing the Mediterranean off from the Atlantic.

Smithian-Spathian Boundary = 
 # Requires translation!
An important extinction event occurred during the Olenekian age of the Early Triassic, near the Smithian and Spathian subage boundary. The main victims of this Smithian-Spathian boundary event, often called the Smithian-Spathian extinction, were 'disaster taxa': Palaeozoic species that survived the Permian-Triassic extinction event and flourished in the immediate aftermath of the extinction; ammonoids, conodonts, and radiolarians in particular suffered drastic biodiversity losses, which is accentuated, among others, by the cosmopolitan distribution of the ammonoid Anasibirites. Marine reptiles, such as ichthyopterygians and sauropterygians, diversified after the extinction. = 

Cytoplasm = Цитоплазма
 # Requires translation!
In cell biology, the cytoplasm describes all material within a eukaryotic cell, enclosed by the cell membrane, except for the cell nucleus. The material inside the nucleus and contained within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm. The main components of the cytoplasm are the cytosol, the organelles, and various cytoplasmic inclusions. The cytoplasm is about 80% water and is usually colorless. =

Gobekli Tepe = 
 # Requires translation!
Göbekli Tepe was built and occupied during the earliest part of the Southwest Asian Neolithic, known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (9600–7000 BCE). Beginning at the end of the last Ice Age, the PPN marks 'the beginnings of village life', producing the earliest evidence for permanent human settlements in the world. Elements of village life appeared as early as 10,000 years before the Neolithic in places, and the transition to agriculture took thousands of years, with different paces and trajectories in different regions. =

Ammonoids = 
 # Requires translation!
Ammonoids are a group of extinct marine mollusc animals in the subclass Ammonoidea of the class Cephalopoda. These molluscs, commonly referred to as ammonites, are more closely related to living coleoids than they are to shelled nautiloids such as the living Nautilus species. The earliest ammonites appeared during the Devonian, with the last species vanishing during or soon after the K-Pg mass extinction event. =

Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse = 
 # Requires translation!
The Carboniferous rainforest collapse was a minor extinction event that occurred around 305 million years ago in the Carboniferous period. It altered the vast coal forests that covered the equatorial region of Euramerica. This event may have fragmented the forests into isolated refugia or ecological 'islands', which in turn encouraged dwarfism and, shortly after, extinction of many plant and animal species. Following the event, coal-forming tropical forests continued in large areas of the Earth, but their extent and composition were changed. =

Cambrian Explosion = Кембрийский взрыв
 # Requires translation!
Before early Cambrian diversification, most organisms were relatively simple, composed of individual cells, or small multicellular organisms, occasionally organized into colonies.

Volcanic activity, particularly that of large igneous provinces, has been speculated to have been the cause of the environmental crisis.

 # Requires translation!
Life for landed lungfishes without natural enemies was inconvenient. This is because life on land is different from the underwater, with no use of fins, obstacles such as trees, fire, limited water sources, and rough terrain.

Once invertebrates were brought to land, they rapidly evolved at a rate unmatched by vertebrates. The secret lies in their low metabolism and high birth rate.

Photosynthesis by this giant fern plant transforms the Earth's environment. The Carboniferous created an oxygen-rich environment that cooled the Earth. Also, the fallen trees did not decompose and produced a lot of coal.
