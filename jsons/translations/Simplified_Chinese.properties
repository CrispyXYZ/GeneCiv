 # Requires translation!
An important extinction event occurred during the Olenekian age of the Early Triassic, near the Smithian and Spathian subage boundary. The main victims of this Smithian-Spathian boundary event, often called the Smithian-Spathian extinction, were 'disaster taxa': Palaeozoic species that survived the Permian-Triassic extinction event and flourished in the immediate aftermath of the extinction; ammonoids, conodonts, and radiolarians in particular suffered drastic biodiversity losses, which is accentuated, among others, by the cosmopolitan distribution of the ammonoid Anasibirites. Marine reptiles, such as ichthyopterygians and sauropterygians, diversified after the extinction. =

Göbekli Tepe was built and occupied during the earliest part of the Southwest Asian Neolithic, known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (9600–7000 BCE). Beginning at the end of the last Ice Age, the PPN marks 'the beginnings of village life', producing the earliest evidence for permanent human settlements in the world. Elements of village life appeared as early as 10,000 years before the Neolithic in places, and the transition to agriculture took thousands of years, with different paces and trajectories in different regions. =

Photosynthesis by this giant fern plant transforms the Earth's environment. The Carboniferous created an oxygen-rich environment that cooled the Earth. Also, the fallen trees did not decompose and produced a lot of coal.
