Smithian-Spathian Boundary = Límite Smithiano-Espático

 # Requires translation!
An important extinction event occurred during the Olenekian age of the Early Triassic, near the Smithian and Spathian subage boundary. The main victims of this Smithian-Spathian boundary event, often called the Smithian-Spathian extinction, were 'disaster taxa': Palaeozoic species that survived the Permian-Triassic extinction event and flourished in the immediate aftermath of the extinction; ammonoids, conodonts, and radiolarians in particular suffered drastic biodiversity losses, which is accentuated, among others, by the cosmopolitan distribution of the ammonoid Anasibirites. Marine reptiles, such as ichthyopterygians and sauropterygians, diversified after the extinction. = Un evento de extinción importante ocurrió durante la era Olenekiense del Triásico Temprano, cerca del límite del subage Smithiano y Spathiano. Las principales víctimas de este evento fronterizo smithiano-espático, a menudo llamado extinción smithiano-espático, fueron los 'taxones de desastre': especies paleozoicas que sobrevivieron al evento de extinción del Pérmico-Triásico y florecieron inmediatamente después de la extinción; Los amonoides, los conodontes y los radiolarios en particular sufrieron pérdidas drásticas de biodiversidad, lo que se ve acentuado, entre otros, por la distribución cosmopolita de los amonoideos Anasibiritas. Los reptiles marinos, como los ictiopterigios y sauropterigios, se diversificaron después de la extinción.

In cell biology, the cytoplasm describes all material within a eukaryotic cell, enclosed by the cell membrane, except for the cell nucleus. The material inside the nucleus and contained within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm. The main components of the cytoplasm are the cytosol, the organelles, and various cytoplasmic inclusions. The cytoplasm is about 80% water and is usually colorless. =

 # Requires translation!
Göbekli Tepe was built and occupied during the earliest part of the Southwest Asian Neolithic, known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (9600–7000 BCE). Beginning at the end of the last Ice Age, the PPN marks 'the beginnings of village life', producing the earliest evidence for permanent human settlements in the world. Elements of village life appeared as early as 10,000 years before the Neolithic in places, and the transition to agriculture took thousands of years, with different paces and trajectories in different regions. =

Ammonoids are a group of extinct marine mollusc animals in the subclass Ammonoidea of the class Cephalopoda. These molluscs, commonly referred to as ammonites, are more closely related to living coleoids than they are to shelled nautiloids such as the living Nautilus species. The earliest ammonites appeared during the Devonian, with the last species vanishing during or soon after the K-Pg mass extinction event. =

Photosynthesis by this giant fern plant transforms the Earth's environment. The Carboniferous created an oxygen-rich environment that cooled the Earth. Also, the fallen trees did not decompose and produced a lot of coal.
