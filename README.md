4.5 billion years ago, there was no life on Earth.
However, for some reason, biogenesis occurs.
Life, which first began as organic compounds, has evolved an astonishing diversity over time.
This mod uses Unciv to transform the that process into a strategy game.
It is probably one of the few efforts to create a strategy game on a geological time scale.

well, It's time to beggining the biggest history!
