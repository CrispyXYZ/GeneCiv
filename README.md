<p align="center">4.5 billion years ago, there was no life on Earth.<br>
However, for some reason, biogenesis occurs.<br>
Life, which first began as organic compounds, has evolved an astonishing diversity over time.<br>
This mod uses Unciv to transform the that process into a strategy game.<br>
It is probably one of the few efforts to create a strategy game on a geological time scale.<br>
<font size="4">well, It's time to beggining the biggest history!</font></p>
