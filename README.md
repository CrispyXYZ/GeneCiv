What is the most wonderful story of the our planet?
Sometimes, they talk about Religious or Great  war.
But I think the most wonderful story of Earth is 4.5 Billion years of Organic Compounds Evolution.
Meteor Bombardment,Beggining of Coral,Age of Fishes,Thrived Reptiles,Domination of Primates...
There are many unique feature in story of our planet.
